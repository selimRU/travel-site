        <p>It was my first visit to the Cox's Bazaar i was so excited and it was not holidays <br> so i have had the
            best view of the sea. As all the other points were crowded we choose <br> Laboni Point to spend our time.
            The sea was calm and we stayed more than 3 hours there. <br> The view of that place will make you spell
            bound. We had enjoyed sunset from the sea <br> and it was the best part of my journey <button>read
